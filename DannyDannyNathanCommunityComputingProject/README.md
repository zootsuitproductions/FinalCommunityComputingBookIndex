This is the root directory for the book indexer java project.
To run the program, you must have a clickable-text pdf of the book or document that you want to be indexed. The program will generate a .txt file, in the same folder as the uploaded pdf (named the same as the pdf document + "BookIndex"), with the pages that each term occurs on. Run the file called "GUI.java"

The testdata folder stores inputs and outputs of sections of the program.
The classifiers folder stores classifiers used by the Named Entity Recognizer.
